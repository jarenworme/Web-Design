        <h2>As Good As Breath of the Wild?</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">One of Nintendo's flagship releases when the Switch first hit the market was The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (BotW) and, as of January 2023, is the fourth best selling Switch game in the console's tenure. According to <a class="inline" href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_best-selling_Nintendo_Switch_games"  target="_blank">this nintendo fandom website</a>, the game has sold over 27 million copies in just seven years. As a result, many casual and hardcore Zelda fans alike are nervous as to whether the sequel to such an amazing game can live up to the hype of its predicessor. The signs point to the game being a large success; not only will it be reusing the general overworld of BotW, one of the most beloved features of the game, but seems to be adding details that fans have missed from the first game. Some of these aspects are more thematic differences in exploration, especially in relation to dungeons and bosses.</p>
        <p class="bodytext"> The couple of small trailers we have gottten so far show promise for this, most notably in the showcase of underground and sky-island areas, not to mention a menacing incarnation of the iconic Ganon and a brief showcase of new abilities for link. With about four months till the game's release, Zelda fans have more reason to be excited as there is bound to be a final trailer released that can reveal even more. If the developers put the amount of care and attention to detail as they have into the first game, and took into consideration fans' biggest criticisms with it, Tears of the Kingdom ought to be one of the most exciting releases of the Switch era.</p>
